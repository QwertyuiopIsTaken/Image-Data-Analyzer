# Image-Data-Analyzer

Utilizing Google Cloud Vision API, this program can effectively scan image files (jpg, jpeg, png, pdf) and extract data from a certain portion of each page.

This program requires you to have a Google API key to access Cloud Vision.

I had huge success in using this for my office work. I made it scan names and ID's to put into a spreadsheet, so it can definitely save you from a lot of typing too.

## Installation

1. Create an API key on console.cloud.google.com.
2. Place the API json file inside the "api_key" folder.

## Instructions

1. Upload all image files inside the "pages" folder.
2. In the command line run `index.js`.
3. Check for the exported CSV file.
